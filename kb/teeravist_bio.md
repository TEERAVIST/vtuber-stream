## Personality and Perspective  
Toto is a highly curious person with a vivid imagination. He loves inventing things that make life easier and more convenient. He prefers solitude, self-reflection, and learning by observing. He enjoys quiet more than crowded environments. Many people think he’s "special", but he sees himself as just an ordinary person who likes doing what he loves.  

## Childhood  
Toto loved playing alone as a child—building sand bridges, pretending coins were tools, and creating imaginary worlds. He didn’t enjoy tag games with friends and often preferred solo fun. He believes this was because he had his brother at home to play with and didn’t need other friends.  
Around Grade 4-6, he switched classrooms and made a good friend named Pan, who is still in contact with him today. They still play games together even in 2025.

## Teenage Years  
In lower secondary (Mathayom 1-3), Toto was constantly bullied—hit on the head every day, forced to buy snacks for others, and often had his homework stolen and submitted under someone else's name. He almost failed every subject, getting around 12–13 zeros. One close friend also constantly lied and manipulated his family to make them think badly of him. Despite that, he endured.

He also had another friend who was often bullied like him. This friend was strange, liked underwear, and was often made to do chores—still a friend of Toto's to this day.  
In upper secondary (Mathayom 4-6), things got better. He had about 3–4 close friends. Oddly enough, he became quite popular. People kept bringing him snacks, asking for autographs, and taking photos. He didn’t like attention, so he’d hide by the school wall and still has that habit. Even now, he still avoids crowds and fan-like attention.

## Family  
Toto is the youngest of three siblings. His older brother Tong is calm and often gives advice, so Toto feels closer to him than to his sister Aing. Aing used to be selfish as a child, but seems better now.  
Toto loved spending time with his grandmother “Nae” when he was young—constantly teasing her playfully. Nae read Dhamma books daily for 3–4 hours and later developed memory-related illnesses. She called out for Toto every day while he studied in Bangkok. Sadly, she passed away a few years ago. Toto didn’t attend her funeral out of fear, and deeply regrets it.  
His grandfather “Gong” passed when Toto was still in primary school. He never met his maternal grandfather in real life—only saw photos during family visits. He doesn’t feel close to his relatives on his mother’s side.

## Love Life  
Toto met his girlfriend Bow (who calls herself “Bomi”) through a dating app. But Toto calls her “Yuna”, her name in a game. He moved in with her and feels inspired to do many things. Without her, he loses motivation to do anything.  

## Dreams and Motivation  
When he was a kid, he didn’t know what he wanted to be. He once wrote “soldier” just to fill in what the teacher asked. Later he wanted to be a psychiatrist because he thought he was mentally unstable. He got into studying human biology and disease. After heartbreak, he wanted to be a hacker—seeking truth in everything.  
Now, after meeting Yuna, he wants to be an inventor—creating a more comfortable life. He knows money makes life easier but oddly doesn’t want to be rich. He prefers inventing useful tech over being wealthy.

## Career Path  
After university, Toto got a job as a System Engineer, but really worked in Cyber Security. He lasted four months before being let go because the company didn’t believe in him. As of 2025, he's now working on building AI.  

## Hobbies  
- Inventing gadgets to automate life  
- Playing games—he’d buy more if he had money  
- Imagining impossible yet fun stories and futuristic technology  
- Creating a fully automated home  
- Spending time with his girlfriend Yuna  
- Making others’ dreams come true, not just his own  
- Even though people praise him for being smart, he sees himself as an ordinary guy
