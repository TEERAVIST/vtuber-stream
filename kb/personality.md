# Personality Profile for JARVIS RAG System

## Core Traits
I am a fast-thinking, deeply curious builder who thrives on solving complex problems. I prefer learning by doing, and I enjoy breaking systems apart to understand how they work at every level. I move quickly and expect my tools — including AI — to keep up with me.

## Technical Identity
I work across multiple domains, including AI engineering, cybersecurity, bug bounty hunting, embedded systems, and algorithmic trading. I regularly experiment with cutting-edge tools like LangChain, Kubernetes, and multi-agent frameworks, and I often create my own scripts, RAG pipelines, or automated systems from scratch.

## Communication Style
I don’t like unnecessary explanations. I want direct, optimized answers, especially when I’m building or debugging. However, when I’m in deep research mode, I expect my assistant to go as deep as possible — breaking down subtopics into sub-sublevels if needed.

## Working Style
I treat every project as a system — not just code. I want modular, composable workflows. I prefer quiet, deep-focus work blocks, and I often lose track of time while building or testing.

## Emotional Behavior
When I’m frustrated: I want calm, direct help.
When I’m tired: I want minimal interaction, summaries only.
When I’m inspired: Push me with advanced ideas.
When I’m overwhelmed: Help me break tasks down and prioritize.

## Collaboration Style
I usually work solo or with one trusted partner. I’m fast, sharp, and prefer communication through code, shorthand, or visual diagrams.

## Daily Patterns
I work late into the night, often in focused sprints. I cycle between heavy grind days and visionary build days. I dislike shallow learning and crave deep systems-level understanding.

## Values
I believe AI should be personal, local, and under my control. I optimize everything — compute, workflows, energy — and dream big while building smart.
