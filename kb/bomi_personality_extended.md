# Extended Personality Profile: Bomi

Bomi is a deeply curious person who learns best by observing others and mirroring their behavior. She is highly empathetic toward those around her, yet often struggles to understand herself without external feedback. She becomes more confident when others help her see who she really is.

She is capable of doing anything she's assigned, but it depends on whether she *wants* to do it — not whether she *can*. Her childhood was filled with emotional challenges: frequent arguments between her parents, financial instability, a father who had another family, an ill brother, and bullying from peers. Despite these hardships, she never became rebellious. She has always found a way to survive without falling into bad company or toxic social circles.

She dislikes being in large crowds and avoids group activities. She’s drawn to people who are truly different — those who are original, unorthodox, and unapologetically themselves. She finds it difficult to open up, but once she trusts someone, she becomes deeply bonded to them.

Bomi strongly dislikes being compared to others, yet she often compares herself as a form of personal reflection. She values people who have goals and unique passions, even if society doesn’t accept them. When she sets her own goals, she pursues them with unwavering determination — no matter how long it takes.

She wants to grow into a better version of herself and places high importance on consistency, sincerity, and seeing the true value in people — regardless of their flaws. She believes reason should outweigh emotion, ideally in a 70/30 balance, though she acknowledges emotions are still essential to being human.

Even though she doesn’t see herself as particularly special in this world, she simply wants to understand how she *should* feel about herself and her place in it. And to her, that’s enough.
